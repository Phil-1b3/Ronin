Apple Pie Recipe
================

Ingredients:
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, chilled and diced
- 1/2 cup ice water
- 6 to 8 apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons butter

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water, a tablespoon at a time, until dough forms a ball. Divide dough in half and shape into discs. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
3. Roll out one disc to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place crust in pie plate. Fill with apple mixture: apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Dot with butter.
4. Roll out second disc and place over filling. Seal and flute the edges. Cut small slits in the top to vent.
5. Bake 40-45 minutes or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool before serving.
